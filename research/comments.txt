the tuning of the confidence threshold for decididng whether there is or not an animal there was very important

find the right balance between image quality resizing when turning video into frames and accuracy of model, also between day and night might differ

trying to classify for cat vs other from trap camera footage makes such low accuray numbers that at the end it does not help decrease manual labor 

it is better to set a friendly environment and tools for the people in the field to help them get the workflow correctly 

thebdetection box was a bit too tight, sometimes even cutting pixels of the animal so we tested and concluded that widening the area by 5% was the best

sorting for only the best frame in confidence score in order to save storage might not be the best because there being higher confidence does not 100% mean it is the best frame to identify the species

rougly what percentage of birds and deer and boar do they get in the footage? also how does that percentage change between day and night?


decided not to include any other similar to deer genus since there were plenty enough of cervus data, same for sus and rat, but for the priolinarus and for the non mammal animals we decided to include some similar animals in tha dataset as well



asking experts in bird watching in tsushima we found that ALL the birds that could be seen in the island even tho most are fleeing birds meaning the can only be seen once a year for a bout 1 or 2 months they still have a chance of appearing in the trap cameras, we decided to filter them by family instead of genus because thats what japanese people were more comfortable talking aout when speaking about animals in general:
